Single Pass Algorithm:

- when you see a label, you dont know the address
- the main idea is to generate the bytecode as you go. Whenever you need to 
  generate for a forward label, stick a hole in your bytecode with a pointer to that hole 
  Once you see the actual address, come back to the hole and fill it in
